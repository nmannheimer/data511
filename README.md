# DATA511: FPL Dashboard

## Execution

Run the following within your conda env to execute the main dash:

```bash
cd scripts
```

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Navigate to:

```bash
http://localhost:8501/
```

The app selects port 8501 by default, but can be controlled by including the flag: --server.port << NEW PORT NUMBER HERE >>

Make sure you are forwarding the correct ports if running remotely
